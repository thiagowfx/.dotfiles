grml-etc-core (0.9.0) grml-testing; urgency=low

  zshrc: use "ctrl-x ." instead ",." to enable power completion /
  abbreviation expansion:

  The use of ",." for enabling the power completion /
  abbreviation expansion / buffer expansion was a bad idea
  because you'll get either a delay or even missing characters,
  e.g. when ",." is part of a copy/paste action. So we decided to
  switch to a safer approach by using "ctrl-x ." instead.

grml-etc-core (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * zshrc: Prompt converted to zsh's prompt theme system:

    This version of the included zsh setup features a prompt theme based
    on the old statically set prompt, that we shipped. The prompt is very
    much customisable. Changing colours or removing and adding information
    used in the prompt is easily possible via zsh's zstyle mechanism. For
    more details call this:

        prompt -h grml

    However, if you used to discard our old prompt and used an own static
    prompt, you need to disable the prompt system so your changes stick,
    because when a prompt theme is active it takes over control of prompt
    variables, which will undo your changes again. So your customisation
    now has to look like this:

        prompt off
        PS1='%~ %# '

    Our prompt is also quite extensible: For example, if you use
    Virtualenv, and would like integration in our prompt, this is how it
    can be done (the default way Virtualenv tries to do this is by
    statically extending $PS1, which doesn't work with zsh themes, as
    discussed above):

        function virtual_env_prompt () {
            REPLY=${VIRTUAL_ENV+(${VIRTUAL_ENV:t}) }
        }
        grml_theme_add_token \
            virtual-env -f virtual_env_prompt '%F{magenta}' '%f'
        zstyle ':prompt:grml:left:setup' items \
            rc virtual-env change-root user at host path vcs percent

  * zshrc: Keyboard setup changed to terminfo data

    This setup had a mixture of hard-coded escape sequences and a broken
    terminfo data extraction scheme.

    Starting with this release, escape sequences are extracted from
    terminfo exclusively (except for a handful of combinations, that are
    commonly not found in terminfo databases). For this to work properly,
    the terminal needs to be switched to "keyboard transmit mode" via the
    `smkx' escape sequence (if a terminal's terminfo entry does not
    support this key, keyboard transmit-mode is active all the time). To
    enable this feature when zsh's line editor (zle) is active, this setup
    now uses the `zle-line-init' and `zle-line-finish' hooks. The former
    invokes the `smkx' sequence and the latter invokes the `rmkx'
    sequence.

    If you override these hooks in your setup, make sure you include the
    following function calls in your own hooks:

        zle-line-init:    zle-smkx
        zle-line-finish:  zle-rmkx

    Unless your system does not have support for terminfo, the new setup
    should work a lot more robust across a much larger number of terminals
    and terminal/terminal-multiplexer combinations.

grml-etc-core (0.3.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged /etc/skel/.zshrc into /etc/zsh/zshrc:

    Starting with grml-etc-core 0.3.62 grml's zsh setup lives only in
    *one* zshrc file - that is the global one: /etc/zsh/zshrc
    /etc/skel/.zshrc still exists but provides commented examples only.
    It is best to leave the /etc/skel/.zshrc file untouched and do
    personal changes to the setup via ${HOME}/.zshrc.local (as before)
    which is loaded at the end of the global zshrc.

    That way, we enable people on other operating systems to use our
    setup, too, just by copying our global zshrc to their ${HOME}/.zshrc.
    Adjustments would still go to the .zshrc.local file.
    Further information is available in the grml-zsh-refcard, available
    at http://grml.org/zsh/

    If you explore *any* problems please let us know:

grml-etc-core (0.3.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please note, that the setup of zsh's completion functions has
    been changed. The setup has been cleaned up but as a sideeffect
    you might notice a problem like:

     "_tags:comptags:67: can only be called from completion function"

    when starting zsh. The reason for this change is because the files
    inside /etc/zsh/completion.d/ have been renamed from 'foo' to
    '_foo' and their content has been adjusted according to the new
    setup too. If you added functions to completion.d yourself, please
    consider moving them to /etc/zsh/functions.d/. Files in that
    directory, not starting with an underscore are marked for
    automatic loading by default (so that is quite convenient).

    So to avoid above error message make sure you don't have any
    dpkg-files *not* starting with a '_' in /etc/zsh/completion.d/
    laying around. If there are files *not* starting with an
    underscore from an older grml-etc-core in completion.d, you may
    safely remove them.

grml-etc-core (0.1-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please note, that the behaviour of global aliases in /etc/skel/.zshrc
    has been changed. Now global aliases won't be expanded automatically
    anymore. You can still use them (and even some more now as well),
    just type the abbreviation/global alias and expand it via pressing
    the key sequence ',.'. Usage example:

    % ls G<press-',.'-here>

    expands to:

    % ls |& grep --color=auto

    Thanks for the contribution, Matthias Kopfermann!
