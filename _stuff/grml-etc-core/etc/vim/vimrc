" All system-wide defaults are set in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim (usually just
" /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/debian.vim) and sourced by the call to :runtime you
" can find below.  If you wish to change any of those settings, you should do it
" in the file /etc/vim/vimrc.local, since debian.vim will be overwritten
" everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed and this file
" (/etc/vim/vimrc) every time the package grml-etc-core is upgraded.  It is
" recommended to make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters the
" value of the 'compatible' option.

" This line should not be removed as it ensures that various options are
" properly set to work with the Vim-related packages available in Debian.

" Uncomment the next line to make Vim more Vi-compatible

" Vim 7 brings cool new features - see ':he version7'!
" The coolest features of Vim7 by mika
" ====================================
"  1) omni/intellisense completion: use CTRL-X CTRL-O in insert mode to start it [:he compl-omni]
"  2) internal grep: vimgrep foo bar [:he vimgrep]
"  3) tab pages: vim -p file1 file2 - then use the :tab command [:he tabpage]
"     gt -> next tab
"     gT -> previous tab
"  4) undo branches: :undolist / :earlier 2h / :later 2h
"     instead of using u (undo) and CTRL-R (redo), you might experiment with g-
"     and g+ to move through the text state [:he undolist]
"  5) browse remote directories via scp using netrw plugin: :edit scp://host//path/to/ [:he netrw.vim]
"  6) start editing the filename under the cursor and jump to the line
"     number following the file name: press gF [:he gF]
"  7) press 'CTRL-W F' to start editing the filename under the cursor in a new
"     window and jump to the line number following the file name. [:he CTRL-W_F]
"  8) spelling correction (see later for its configuration) [:he spell]:
"      ]s  -> Move to next misspelled word after the cursor.
"      zg  -> Add word under the cursor as a good word to the first name in 'spellfile'
"      zw  -> Like "zg" but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word.
"      z=  -> For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly spelled words.
" 9)  highlight active cursor line using 'set cursorline' [:he cursorline]
" 10) delete inner quotes inside HTML-code using <C-O>cit (see its mapping later) [:he tag-blocks]
