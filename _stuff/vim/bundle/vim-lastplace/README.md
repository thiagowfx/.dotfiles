# vim-lastplace v2.0.1
Intelligently reopen files where you left off.

## Introduction

Intelligently reopen files where you left off.  By default git,
svn, and mercurial commit messages are ignored because you
probably want to type a new message and not re-edit the previous
one.

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting
g:lastplace_ignore. For example to only ignore git and svn commit
messages try this in your vimrc:

        let g:lastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,svn"

## Installation
I recommend using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/dietsche/vim-lastplace.git
