INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-lastplace-introduction*

Intelligently reopen files where you left off.  By default git,
svn, and mercurial commit messages are ignored because you
probably want to type a new message and not re-edit the previous
one.

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting g:lastplace_ignore.
For example to only ignore git and snv commit messages try this in your vimrc:

        let g:lastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,svn,asciidoc"
