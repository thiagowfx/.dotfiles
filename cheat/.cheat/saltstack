Salt Master and Salt Minion
---------------------------

* Minions connect to master, the reverse does not happen
* Ports 4505 and 4506 must be open on the master
* Convention over configuration: default master address in minions is `salt`
* Python-based
* Master salt usually contains its own minion too
* Several minions might optionally run in the same machine, however only one is usually enough

Salt-key
--------

Master commands:

```bash
salt-key: prints (i) accepted, (ii) unaccepted, and (iii) rejected keys
salt-key -f <minion>: shows the fingerprint of the given key
salt-key -d <minion>: deletes the given key
salt-key -a <minion>: accepts the given key
```

Minion commands:

```bash
salt-call --local key.finger: prints the fingerprint of the local key
```

Salt
----

```bash
salt '*' test.ping
```
