Salt Master and Salt Minion Concepts
------------------------------------

* Minions connect to master, the reverse does not happen
* Ports 4505 and 4506 must be open on the master
* Convention over configuration: default master address in minions is `salt`
* Python-based
* Master salt usually contains its own minion too
* Several minions might optionally run in the same machine, however only one is usually enough

Salt-key master commands (salt-key)
-----------------------------------

```bash
salt-key: prints (i) accepted, (ii) unaccepted, and (iii) rejected keys
salt-key -f <minion>: shows the fingerprint of the given key
salt-key -d <minion>: deletes the given key
salt-key -a <minion>: accepts the given key
```

Salt minion commands (salt-call)
--------------------------------

* `--local` forces the minion to operate completely locally, without the master

```bash
salt-call --local key.finger: prints the fingerprint of the local key
salt-call test.ping
salt-call test.fib 10
```

Salt introspection
------------------

* The `sys` module is important.

```bash
salt '*' test.ping
salt '*' sys.list_functions test
salt '*' sys.doc test.fib
salt '*' sys.doc test
salt '*' sys.list_functions sys
```
